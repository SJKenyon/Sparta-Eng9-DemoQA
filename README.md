## Test Plan

### Scope of the Project

We are going to cover over twenty user journeys: we have broken down each into its constituent use cases within the feature files.

### Assumptions

We assume that the Demo QA website is not going to be subject to changes: this will enable our test framework to remain valid for the duration of the project.

### Schedules

Sprint 1: Monday 18th June to 10h30 on Wednesday 21st June
During this sprint we will define the use cases, prioritise them, and articulate them in the Gherkin syntax in various feature files. We will build our automated test framework for those use cases with the highest priority rating (8).

Sprint 2: Thursday 21st June to 10h30 on Tuesday 26th June.
During Sprint 2 we will focus on building the parts of the framework relevant to the use cases rated lower in priority.


### Roles and Responsibilities

Team members: Sophie Kenyon and Evie Skinner

Test lead / Scrum Master / Product Owner: Richard Gurney

The responsibilities will be shared evenly between the two team members, with one taking over responsibility for the project when the other is obliged to attend an interview or similar commitment. In Sprint 1 Evie will build the parts of the framework that will test the Product use cases, and Sophie will build those that will test the Login and Register use cases.


### Deliverables

- Draw out the use cases
- Make the scrum board
- Update the Trello board
- Prioritise user journeys
- Write the test plan
- Test as much of the Demo QA site as possible in one week.


### Environment

We are using Git for version control; Cucumber to run the tests (with Gherkin syntax to write the use cases); with Selenium WebDriver and Capybara as automation tools. In addition, Trello will be used to manage the progress of the project.

### Defect Management

Defects will be reported to the Test Lead Rich Gurney, by showing him in person or via his regular reviews of the team's pull requests on GitHub.

### Exit Criteria

We will stop testing either when we have tested all of the use cases, or when we deem a sufficient proportion of the use cases to have been covered within the time frame.
